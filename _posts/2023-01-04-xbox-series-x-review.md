It have been a couple of rough months so I haven’t been able to write for a while, so I will start with something simple, reviewing the «We don’t talk about Bruno…» I mean, the Xbox Series X.

I used to have a PS4 as some of you people know, after that I decide to change to the light, literally. I bought a Xbox Series S.

I won’t talk about why I change brands, I already have an article for that, I will just give you my thoughts about upgrading from a Xbox Series S.

Short answer: No

# Why?

The little big guy is capable of do much of the things his big brother can. I believe the change is more about fanciness. Let me elaborate:

You get 4K most of the time: If you are a purist (not like me), you probably will notice that the dashboard and all Next Gen games will look in 4K what is great. But to be honest, the 1080p from the Series S is more than enough.
One X retrocompatible games: This one was one of the decisive factors to me. I like 60fps games. this generation ruin my mind and I believe is the best upgrade a game can have. The bad thing is games like FFXV only have it for the One X, so, Series X also have them. I believe the Series S is capable of run this, is just a marketing situation, but hey, if you wanna play some older games with that mid tier upgrade generation, go for it! Besides, looks like FFVII Remake is not going to happen anytime soon…
Series S is prettier: You can carry it easier, is lighter and easy to put in a shelf. But… The Series X looks like a powerful PC, so who doesn’t want power?
More internal space: From 360GB to 920GB is a big internal space upgrade in the Series X
Besides that, I still believe whatever console you buy is a great choice:

- Series S is still easier to find
- Xbox is a great brand, so changing from PlayStation is something I’m glad I did
- Even with the new competitor from Play Station, the PS Plus Tiers, keeps a little behind the Game Pass
- Everyday there is more JRPGs on Xbox, that way, yo can play what you want, anywhere you want.
- Finally, try to get a good TV for it, you will take advantage of all the other technologies the console have, like Dolby Vision & Atmos and 120fps in some games. OLED TVs are a good choice for that.

After all that, the long answer is: Upgrade it if you’re gonna use it, you won’t regret it.

Happy gaming!
