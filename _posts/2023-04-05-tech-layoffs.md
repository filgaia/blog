# “The bubble has to stop” — Someone in the mundial order says.

Post pandemic is hard for tech, way harder than pandemic. A lot of companies decide remote and e-commerce was the future so they increase their manforce to sustain that operation. But then, pandemic was over, and everyone decides that those two years never happen, and so, those jobs.

So, companies need to regulate, and they start seeing they don’t need that much manforce in tech. Why having a great platform if we can have a really bad in-person service? So winter comes and a lot of heads roll.

The worst part is that is no over yet, companies haven’t reach they balance point so layoffs gonna continue.

I wanna believe this is not going to be forever, this is gonna end at some point. Besides, bad times can last forever and new ideas will come up from customers that doesn’t have a clue of how to explain then, so there we will come it, trying to figure out what they want without a crystal ball to resolve the mysteries of the future they uphold.

# “Resession” — Another powerful word that come up this days.

I also believe this is mediatic control. The world is not ending and much less the economy. Dollar will keep at the top and other countries like mine in the rush to catching up. But “The bubble has to stop”. So war begins, and companies decide “investing is risky” when all their life they have work like that. So social control and economic control enter in place.

I hope the “mundial order” decides to end this soon, because we all know they are influential people that make things happens in politics and economy, so if they decide the crisis is over, we can all go back to our daily lifes.

So, hang in there, I know is tough, and I also know I should give you more hope, but for all the readings I find about the layoffs, the crisis, al all that shit, I expect to give you something different to believe in, and if you were layoff, you can do better, their lost.

Next time, opinion about the incoming zombie root and how they organize to kill us all.
